    #### Understanding Smart Grids:
    Grid stability refers to the ability of an electrical power grid to maintain a balance between energy production and consumption while responding effectively to fluctuations in voltage and frequency. Traditional power grids, often fueled by non-renewable energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas, rely on centralized systems and synchronous generators to maintain this balance, making stability relatively straightforward to achieve.
    However, with the increasing integration of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, the dynamics of grid stability have become more complex. Unlike traditional energy systems, renewable energy is inherently variable and intermittent, requiring advanced mechanisms to ensure stability.

    For a grid to remain stable, energy supply must equal energy demand. Any imbalance‚Äîwhether excess energy generation or higher energy consumption‚Äîcan lead to frequency disturbances, voltage volatility, or even power outages. Addressing these challenges requires rapid adjustments to restore equilibrium, making the stability of modern grids essential for a reliable power supply.
    The future of energy grids lies in innovative solutions that can adapt to renewable energy sources, ensuring stability while driving sustainability.

    #### Renewable Energy Sources and Smart Grids:
    The rise of **renewable energy sources** offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels but brings new challenges:
    
    - **Prosumers**: Consumers who both produce and consume energy, making smart grids **bidirectional**.
    - **Complex Supply-Demand Management**: With more flexible generation sources, managing supply-demand and pricing decisions has become more challenging.
    
    These changes highlight the importance of **smart grid stability**.

    #### Objective:
    The goal of this project is to predict the stability of a smart grid based on various input parameters including reaction times, power distribution, and price elasticity coefficients for each participant.

    The stability of the grid depends on these values, and the prediction is made using a trained machine learning model.

    #### Key Features:
    - Predict whether a smart grid is stable or unstable based on user inputs.
    - Visualize key data insights such as correlations and distributions of power.
    - Simple user interface for ease of prediction.

    #### Data:
    The data used for training the model includes parameters like:

    - **`tau1`** to **`tau4`**: Reaction time of each network participant (in seconds), a real value within the range **0.5 to 10**.
        - `tau1`: Corresponds to the supplier node.
        - `tau2` to `tau4`: Correspond to the consumer nodes.

    - **`p1`** to **`p4`**: Nominal power produced (positive) or consumed (negative) by each network participant (in megawatts), a real value within the range:  
        - `p1` (supplier node): Positive values, indicating power supplied.  
        - `p2` to `p4` (consumer nodes): Negative values, within the range **-2.0 to -0.5**.  
        - **Power Balance**: The total power consumed is equal to the total power generated: **`p1 = - (p2 + p3 + p4)`**.

    - **`g1`** to **`g4`**: Price elasticity coefficients (gamma), a real value within the range **0.05 to 1.00**.  
        - `g1`: Corresponds to the supplier node.  
        - `g2` to `g4`: Correspond to the consumer nodes.
        
    #### Modeling Grid Stability:
    In **smart grids**, consumer demand data is evaluated against supply conditions, and pricing information is sent back to consumers. The objective is to dynamically estimate grid stability by considering both technical and economic factors. Researchers focus on the **Decentral Smart Grid Control (DSGC)** methodology, which monitors **grid frequency**, an important indicator of grid stability.
    
    - **Frequency**: AC frequency (in Hz) increases during excess generation and decreases during underproduction. This measurement provides critical information about power balance.
    - **DSGC Model**: Evaluates grid stability for a 4-node star architecture, accounting for:
      - **Power balance** (nominal power at each node)
      - **Reaction time** (how quickly participants adjust consumption/production in response to price)
      - **Energy price elasticity**

    st.write("""
    #### Addressing Simplifications in the Model:
    While the mathematical model for predicting grid instability exists, its execution relies on significant simplifications. The DSGC model, based on differential equations, is often simulated with fixed values for some variables and fixed distributions for others. This leads to two main issues: **"fixed inputs issue"** and **"equality issue"**.

    To overcome these simplifications, **machine learning** techniques, such as **decision trees (CART)** and **space-filling designs**, are used. Here's how it works:
    
    1. Input parameters (a vector) are fed into the DSGC model.
    2. The model outputs a binary result: **stable** or **unstable**.
    3. This process is repeated multiple times to generate a dataset of inputs and their respective outputs.
    4. The resulting dataset is used by machine learning models to make predictions about grid stability.
    
    As a result, **CART-based learning** achieves accuracy rates of **around 80%** in predicting grid stability or instability.

    ##### Artificial Neural Network:
    
    The optimal artificial neural network (ANN) evaluated in this study reflects a sequential structure with:

    - **One input layer** (12 input nodes)
    - **Three hidden layers** (24, 24, and 12 nodes, respectively)
    - **One single-node output layer**

    As the features are numerical real numbers within specific ranges, the choice of **'ReLU'** as the activation function for hidden layers is straightforward. Similarly, as this is a logistic classification task (where the output is binary: '0' for 'unstable' and '1' for 'stable'), the choice of **'sigmoid'** as the activation function for the output layer is appropriate.

    The model is compiled using:
    - **Optimizer**: 'adam'
    - **Loss function**: 'binary_crossentropy'
    - **Metric**: 'accuracy'
